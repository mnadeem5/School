  <p><strong>Career: International career </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Career start</strong></p>
  <p>In an interview with FourFourTwo Magazine, Özil spoke about his choice to play for the German national team: &quot;I am third generation in Germany: my father grew up here. Turkey will always be a special country for me but I did not doubt my decision to play for Germany – ever. I started to play for Germany in the youth teams.&quot;</p>
  <p>In September 2006, Özil was called up for the Germany under-17 team. Özil has been a member of the German under-21 team since 2007. On 29 June 2009, Özil was selected the man of the match in a 4–0 win over England during the U-21 European Championship final.</p>
  <p>He made his debut for the senior side during a friendly match against Norway on 11 February 2009. He scored his first goal for the senior team in his third appearance, another friendly, against South Africa on 5 September in Leverkusen at the BayArena.</p>
